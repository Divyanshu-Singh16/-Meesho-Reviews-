# Sentiment Analysis on Meesho Reviews  

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from **Meesho**, an e-commerce platform, to understand customer sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).  

The goal is to apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to real-world data and explore how text reviews can be converted into insights that help businesses improve customer satisfaction and product quality.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Collected and used a dataset of **Meesho product reviews with ratings**.  
- Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and text normalization (removing stopwords, stemming/lemmatization, etc.).  
- Built and compared different machine learning/NLP models for sentiment classification.  
- Visualized results to see how customers express their opinions across different ratings.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk` / `spacy`  

---

## 🚀 Key Features  
- Data preprocessing pipeline for text reviews.  
- Sentiment classification (positive/negative/neutral).  
- Visualizations: word clouds, distribution of ratings, model performance metrics.  
- End-to-end workflow from raw dataset → cleaned text → trained model → evaluation.

## 🔑 Learnings  
- Hands-on practice with **sentiment analysis using NLP**.  
- Experience in **data cleaning and preprocessing** for real-world text.  
- Comparison of machine learning models for text classification.  
- How unstructured customer reviews can drive insights for businesses.  

---

## 📊 Sample Results  
- Achieved [insert accuracy/precision/recall numbers if you have them].  
- Most negative reviews revolved around [insert key finding like “product quality”].  
- Positive reviews often highlighted [insert key finding like “delivery speed”].  

---

## 💡 Future Improvements  
- Deploying the model as a simple web app (e.g., using Streamlit).  
- Trying deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for better accuracy.  
- Expanding dataset with more diverse reviews.
